# smittyhelp
This script will hex encode and decode email addresses for use with the smitty email client (https://github.com/tomsteele/smitty). This is particularly useful on phishing engagements when you are tracking unique click-throughs. Additional functionality to scrape the hex strings from apache logs will be added..well.. whenever I feel like it.

Be sure to have the docopts package installed:
sudo pip install docopts
